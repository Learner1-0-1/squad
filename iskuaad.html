        <h1>We are The Iskuaad</h1>
        <p>This website is dedicated to no one. Please don’t proceed with caution.</p><br>

        <h1>Who are we?</h1>
        <p>We are a bunch of individuals from India, who spent the most of our time doing nothing. :)

            If you are not like us, We can’t be friends. :(

            This website is a gimick to trick our families into thinking that we are actually doing something in our
            lives. So far it seems to be working. :)</p>
    </div>

    <div class="third">
        <h1>Why are we here?</h1>
        <p>We are here to flaunt our talents, show you what we can do.

            If it seems to be very empty, it kind of speaks volumes about our tallents. :(

            But as a wise man once said,
            ”Don’t judge a cover by it’s book”

            We stand by this wise man. He is weird.</p>
